Procedures: The BASINS data product was derived from the U.S. Geological Survey COUNTIES2M layer. The USGS procedures for that data product are followed by the BASINS procedures: 

This series of maps was published as part of the National Atlas of the United States (USGS, 1970). The maps for the conterminous United States were digitized in 15 sheets and published in the Digital Line Graph (DLG) format as described by Domeratz and others (1983). 

Each sheet was prepared by reading the DLG files of the political and water bodies layers, converting them to ARC/INFO, extracting the county boundaries and the coastline, respectively, and joining the two layers together. FIPS codes were assigned to all polygons using available sources, and were checked manually. 

Boundaries with adjacent sheets of the 15-sheet set were edgematched manually, arbitrarily choosing one of the sheets as the "correct" border. Edgematching operations adjusted the linework as far as was necessary so that the coverages would fit to a tolerance of 100 meters. The coverage (referred to herein as Version 1.0) was stored as 49 separate coverages (48 states and the District of Columbia) because the ARC/INFO software in use at the time could not process the entire coverage. Individual states could be joined by specifying a tolerance of 100 meters. 

From time to time, adjustments were made to the state coverages to reflect changes in U.S. counties. It is believed the accuracy of these adjustments is comparable to the original linework. 

For Version 2.0, all state coverages were rejoined and manually edited to produce a perfect edgematch between all states. For states on the original map sheet boundaries, this adjustment averaged less than 20 meters and in no case was more than 100 meters. The whole coverage was CLEANed to a tolerance of 20 meters, which resulted in few, if any, effects on small offshore islands. The coverage also was checked to ensure that it represented current U.S. counties or county equivalents. 

The coverage in Version 1.0 stopped at the coastline. There was no attempt to depict offshore areas. The created some problems when the coverage was used to assign county codes to sampling stations located near the coast. To help in this matter, Version 2.o includes offshore extensions of the county polygons. The (water) boundaries of many of these polygons are arbitrary. 

The Canadian Great Lakes features are another new addition to Version 2.0. They were added to improve the utility of the coverage for visual displays. Although the Canadian Great Lakes are logically represented by a single polygon, practical considerations -- the inability of some software to plot polygons with a large number of vertices -- made it necessary to separate them into 4 polygons. The dividing lines are located in narrow channels to minimize interference with plotting patterns. Canadian islands within the Great Lakes also were included. 

All tics were relocated to places that are easily visible on maps of the United States, to help in registering maps that may not otherwise have adequate registration information. 

To expedite accessing parts of the coverage, certain items have been indexed with the procedure, index_county.aml. See Section 3 above. A spatial index also was created. 

When using this coverage to clip or intersect other coverages, a tolerance as low as 2 meters can be used. 

The processing used to derive this coverage moved boundaries from their positions on the original maps. In cases of conflicting lines, preference was given to forming the correct topology. Strictly speaking, this coverage is not identical to the source materials. These changes were unavoidable in producing a continuous coverage of the conterminous United States. 

For revision 2.1, it was necessary to alter about 100 arcs. This was accomplished with ARCEDIT using the 1:100,000 TIGER county coverage as a background. These arcs were matched to the background so that they matched at least as close as other arcs that were not edited. 

For distribution with BASINS v1.0, the national coverage was split into a series of coverages that included the spatial extent of each of the nine US EPA regions, plus the hydrologic accounting units that crossed Region boundaries. The nine regional coverages therefore overlapped at Regional boundaries. The coverages were distributed in PC ARC/INFO coverage format. 

For distribution with Basins v2.0, the PA ARC/INFO coverages were exported on a PC then imported in workstation ARC/INFO v7.0.4. Each Regional coverage was then projected to geographic decimal degrees, NAD83. The coverages were then converted to ESRI Shapefile format, using the ARCSHAPE command. 


Reviews_Applied: This coverage has received no formal review. It has, however, been used in numerous applications where serious errors would have been obvious. Some county coverages were corrected following such use. The offshore polygon extensions and the Canadian Great Lakes polygons have had no review. 

BASINS v2.0 reviews: projected coverages were checked for topology. The shapefile format features and attributes were visually inspected and compared with the BASINS v1.0 PC ARC/INFO coverages. 


Other_Related_Data_Sets: This coverage was derived from USGS 1:2,000,000-scale basemaps covering the United States.
